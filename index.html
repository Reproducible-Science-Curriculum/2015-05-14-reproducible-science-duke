<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  Making science more reproducible has the potential to advance
  scientific research and make researchers' work more effective and productive.
  For computational and data-intensive research, which is increasingly
  pervasive across the sciences, this is particularly true, and yet is often
  seen as difficult to achieve. In this 2-day bootcamp-style hands-on workshop,
  we will teach a number of tools, resources, and practices that can be employed
  today to make one's computational science more reproducible.
</p>
<p>
  The course is co-run by Duke's Center for Genomic and Computational Biology (<a href="http://genome.duke.edu/" target="_blank">GCB</a>), and is the result of
  the <a href="https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014">Reproducible
  Science Curriculum Hackathon</a> that was held December 8-11, 2014, at the
  National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (<a href="nescent.org">NESCent</a>) in
  Durham. The hackathon and instructor travel are supported by the National
  Science Foundation (NSF).
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students, postdocs, and other
  researchers who perform computational analysis or work. The material
  on automation uses basic R for teaching and illustrating the key
  concepts. Advanced knowledge of R is not needed.
</p>

<!--

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

      <p>
	<a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
	popular free code editor for Windows.  Be aware that you must
	add its installation directory to your system path in order to

      </p>
      <h4>Software Carpentry Installer</h4>
      <p><em>This installer requires an active internet connection.</em></p>
      <p>After installing Python and Git Bash:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">installer</a>.

  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes

	by downloading and running
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/latest/download">the installer</a>.
	After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
	as Git is a command line program.
	<strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.7)</strong> use the
	most recent available installer for your
	OS <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available

  <h3>Python</h3>

    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
